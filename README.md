# Before starting...
Ensure you are running Matlab version 2024a or above and have installed the [Aerospace Blockset](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/aerospace-blockset.html).
Clone the repository to your machine.

# Using the environment
Double-click the ThermalUpdraftModel.prj project file to open the project. Use the GUI to set up the simulation. Load an IGC file, run the automatic thermal detection or add thermals manually and search for atmospheric soundings on the day of the flight. Select at least one sounding from the table and send the data to the model. Run the model and visualize the output in the simulation data inspector.
