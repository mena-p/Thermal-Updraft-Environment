function reduced_sounding = extract_sounding_data(sounding)
    % Extract and return only the relevant data in a sounding,
    % and return a reduced sounding object. If a row contains missing
    % reported geopotential height values, they are filled with the
    % corresponding calculated geopotential height values. Rows that
    % still contain missing reported geopotential height values are
    % removed.
    %
    % The following parameters are extracted:
    % - mixed layer height
    % - lifting condensation level
    % The following profiles are extracted:
    % - geopotential heights
    % - pressure profile
    % - temperature profile
    % - potential temperature profile
    % - virtual temperature profile
    % - vapor pressure profile
    % - saturated vapor pressure profile
    % - relative humidity profile
